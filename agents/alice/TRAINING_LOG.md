Conventions: every iteration logged with hypothesis, pre-registered variables,
measurements, decision. Snapshots in `src/alice_iterN/`. Gauntlet output in
`gauntlet/` (git-ignored, pruned).

## Phase 0 (2026-09-06)

- `RULES.md` written from spec v3.1.0 + engine source (GameWorld/InternalRobot/
  UnitType/GameConstants pulled from official repo; jar 3.1.0 on VM matches).
- **Determinism verified**: alice vs examplefuncsplayer on DefaultSmall run twice
  → replays byte-identical. Only engine nondeterminism: final tiebreak #6 uses
  `Math.random()`.
- Key asymmetries (details in RULES.md):
  - Splasher hits towers at up to dist^2 16 vs paint/money tower range 9 →
    free siege. Defense tower range 16 matches it exactly.
  - Defense towers (16) outrange soldiers (9); paint/money towers (9) tie soldiers.
  - Clumping tax: -1 paint/adjacent ally/turn (x2 on enemy paint).
  - Paint win = >=70% of (area minus walls); ruins count in denominator.
  - Messaging robot<->tower needs 4-adjacent ally-paint connectivity; tower->tower
    broadcast r^2<=80 unconditional.
- Turn order: robots execute by (roundsAlive, ID) — older first.
- Bytecode monitoring wired into iteration 0 (overrun = round advanced mid-logic;
  near-miss = within ~15% of limit; surfaced in indicator string every turn).

## Iteration 0 — baseline (ACCEPTED by definition, 2026-09-06)

Minimal instrumented bot, own code (package `alice`), replacing seeded example copy:
- soldiers complete money-tower patterns on ruins, paint own tile, wander (xorshift
  PRNG seeded by ID; tie-breaks randomized to avoid side bias)
- moppers mop adjacent enemy paint (prefer robbing robots), wander
- towers: single-target lowest-HP enemy + AoE, spawn ~75% soldiers / 25% moppers
- splashers: logic present but never built yet
- Result vs examplefuncsplayer, DefaultSmall side A: WIN by paint r250.
- Snapshot: `src/alice_iter0/`.
