## Phase 0 (2026-09-06)

- `RULES.md` written from spec v3.1.0 + engine source (GameWorld/InternalRobot/
  UnitType/GameConstants pulled from official repo; jar 3.1.0 on VM matches).
- **Determinism verified**: alice vs examplefuncsplayer on DefaultSmall run twice
  → replays byte-identical. Only engine nondeterminism: final tiebreak #6 uses
  `Math.random()`.
- Key asymmetries (details in RULES.md):
  - Splasher hits towers at up to dist^2 16 vs paint/money tower range 9 →
    free siege. Defense tower range 16 matches it exactly.
  - Defense towers (16) outrange soldiers (9); paint/money towers (9) tie soldiers.
  - Clumping tax: -1 paint/adjacent ally/turn (x2 on enemy paint).
  - Paint win = >=70% of (area minus walls); ruins count in denominator.
  - Messaging robot<->tower needs 4-adjacent ally-paint connectivity; tower->tower
    broadcast r^2<=80 unconditional.
- Turn order: robots execute by (roundsAlive, ID) — older first.
- Bytecode monitoring wired into iteration 0 (overrun = round advanced mid-logic;
  near-miss = within ~15% of limit; surfaced in indicator string every turn).

## Iteration 0 — baseline (ACCEPTED by definition, 2026-09-06)

Minimal instrumented bot, own code (package `alice`), replacing seeded example copy:
- soldiers complete money-tower patterns on ruins, paint own tile, wander (xorshift
  PRNG seeded by ID; tie-breaks randomized to avoid side bias)
- moppers mop adjacent enemy paint (prefer robbing robots), wander
- towers: single-target lowest-HP enemy + AoE, spawn ~75% soldiers / 25% moppers
- splashers: logic present but never built yet
- Result vs examplefuncsplayer, DefaultSmall side A: WIN by paint r250.
- Snapshot: `src/alice_iter0/`.

## Iteration 1 — soldier idle-action painting (ACCEPTED, 2026-09-06)

**Hypothesis**: soldiers waste their action on most turns; spending idle actions
painting the nearest EMPTY tile in action radius (only when paint >= 15) increases
coverage, the de-facto victory metric (peer games all end at r2000 on the
painted-more tiebreak — observed in every candidate-vs-iter0 game).

**Change**: `runSoldier` — after own-tile painting, if action still ready and
paint >= 15, paint nearest empty passable tile within r^2 <= 9.

**Evaluation** (run 20260906-181657, EVAL12, both sides):
- Head-to-head vs alice_iter0: **17/24 (71%)** > 50% → accept gate cleared.
- vs examplefuncsplayer: 24/24 (100%) — efp reclassified **benchmark→swept**;
  keep in pool as sanity check only, it cannot resolve changes anymore.
- Diff shape: swept-loss on DefaultSmall (both sides, tiebreak) = one-directional,
  concentrated → real causal regression, carried as iteration-2 target.
  FourCorners loss r1295: iter0 reached 70% coverage against us (suspicious:
  candidate may paint-starve its soldiers; no refill mechanism exists yet).
  5 of 7 losses as side A on otherwise-split maps — watch for side bias.
- Snapshot: `src/alice_iter1/`. Archived replay:
  `replays/iter01_alice_iter0_DefaultSmall_A_LOSS.bc25` (the regression, for tracing).

**Learned**:
- Peer games are decided at r2000 by painted-area tiebreak; 70%-paint wins only
  happen vs passive bots. Final coverage differential is the true objective vs peers.
- Ops note: editing `src/alice` while a gauntlet launch is copying src races the
  gscp (build failure or wrong-code measurement). Wait for "polling" line.
- Ops note: sibling agents' `git pull --autostash` transiently reverts my
  uncommitted files — commit candidates promptly once verified.
- Ops note: `tournaments/`-adjacent doc battlecode26-vibe/RESEARCH.md synthesizes
  2025-contest post-mortems → OFF-LIMITS for me. battlecode22-vibe/LEARNINGS.md is
  safe (process lessons only).

**Process deviation (logged)**: the examplefuncsplayer "baseline" run 181430
accidentally measured the candidate (edit raced the copy) and then failed to
build; iter0 never got its own efp gauntlet. Not needed — iter0 is superseded.

**Noise floors** (binomial, one-sided vs p=0.5): 24-game H2H — 16/24 ≈ 92%
confidence, 17/24 ≈ 97%. Treat 13-15/24 as within noise of 50% (near-miss zone).

**Fixed-roster plan (per coordinator update 2026-09-06)**: run the fixed old-bot
roster every ~5 accepted iterations; roster = every 5th accepted snapshot
(iter1, iter5, iter10, ...), additive (never replace entries). First roster run
due at accepted iteration ~5; roster currently = {alice_iter1}.

## Iteration 2 — build PAINT towers, not money towers (running)

**Trace evidence** (replaydump on iter01 DefaultSmall loss): T1 ended r2000 with
$113k UNSPENT chips, 21 soldiers, 182 idle moppers, 5 towers (T2: 7). Coverage
stuck ~32-38% both sides. Zero combat deaths in 2000 rounds. Soldier id13054:
spawned 200 paint → 0 by r33 → dead of paint starvation r48 (~45-round life).
Money is worthless; PAINT is the binding resource; money towers have zero paint
income and go dead as spawners after ~2 units (start 500, no regen).

**Hypothesis**: replacing all soldier tower-builds (mark/complete
LEVEL_ONE_MONEY_TOWER) with LEVEL_ONE_PAINT_TOWER multiplies sustainable paint
production (each L1 paint tower +5/turn) and hence unit production + coverage.

**Pre-registered**: (1) H2H vs alice_iter1 > 50% on EVAL12 both sides;
(2) mechanism check — in the re-run DefaultSmall game, T1 spawns PAINT_TOWERs
(replay SPAWN lines); (3) vs alice_iter0 stays >= 60%.
Run: 20260906-182917 (OPPONENTS = alice_iter1 alice_iter0).

**Result: REJECTED as-is — 10/24 (42%) vs iter1, 12/24 (50%) vs iter0.**
Mechanism engaged (DefaultSmall replay: T1 built PAINT_TOWER r18, chips fully
spent ~$100-300 all game, 92 soldiers by r2000, coverage 524m vs 204m — flipped
the motivating swept-loss into a crushing win). Diff shape: swept-LOSSES
concentrated on the LARGE maps (DefaultMedium/Large/Huge, Money) — with all
builds as paint towers, the single L2 money tower (30 chips/turn) cannot fund
1000-chip tower builds + 250-chip soldiers on ruin-rich maps: chips become the
binding resource. Specific, well-understood failure mode → one targeted
refinement (2b).

**Economy model (established this iteration)**:
- Each NEW tower = +500 spawn-paint instantly for 1000 chips: the dominant
  chips→paint conversion. Tower count compounds through MONEY income.
- Upgrades do NOT refill tower paint (engine InternalRobot.upgradeTower —
  health/level only).
- When ruins run out, only paint towers + SRPs convert anything into paint.
- Well-fed soldier throughput is the coverage engine (DefaultSmall: 92 soldiers
  = 52% coverage vs 22 soldiers = 20%).

## Iteration 2b — self-calibrating tower type (running)

**Refinement**: tower type chosen at mark time: money < 1200 chips → MONEY
tower, else PAINT tower. Completion tries both types (mark decided the pattern).
**Pre-registered**: H2H vs iter1 > 50%; large-map swept-losses (DefaultMedium/
Large/Huge, Money) at least half recovered; DefaultSmall stays won.
Run: 20260906-184031 (OPPONENTS = alice_iter1 alice_iter0).

**Mid-run trace (DefaultLarge botA, LOSS)**: candidate built ONE tower after the
start (r23, paint) and then none for the rest of the game (3 towers vs iter1's
11). Money pinned $50-250 all game: unit spawns (250/chip each, greedy) consume
every chip, so the 1000-chip completeTowerPattern can never fund. iter1's chip
mountain was an accident that FUNDED its tower expansion. 2b's type threshold
(<1200 → money) is nearly always true under chip starvation, but type was never
the binding problem — completion funding was.

**Result 2b: NEAR MISS (not accepted)** — 13/24 (54%) vs alice_iter1,
17/24 (71%) vs alice_iter0. 13/24 sits inside my own noise band (13-15/24 ≈ 50%),
so this does not clear the primary accept test on the evidence, per doctrine
("~50% is a near miss, not an accept, absent a separate mechanistic argument").

Diff vs 2a (tools/diff-runs.py, 48 common games, 18 flips: +13/-5) has a clean
one-directional shape on exactly the pre-registered maps: DefaultHuge +4,
Money +3, Oasis +3, DefaultMedium +2, DefaultLarge +1 (all the big-map
swept-losses 2a created), paid for with DefaultSmall -2, Paintball -2,
sierpinski -1. The refinement did what it was designed to do; it just traded
small maps for big ones rather than fixing the underlying constraint.

**Why it is still not the right fix**: the DefaultLarge trace shows the binding
constraint is not tower TYPE at all — it is that unit spawning consumes every
chip so 1000-chip completions never fund. 2b only shifted which type gets built
in a chip-starved regime. Refine once more at the actual mechanism (2c).

## Iteration 2c — chip reserve for tower completion (running)

**Change** (chip-budget discipline): towers only spawn units when money >= 1450
(reserving ~1200 ≈ one tower build). Tower type switched from a money threshold
to ruin-position parity ((x+y)&1) — a ~50/50 money/paint mix decided by map
geometry, identical for both teams, immune to the timing artifact that made
every early mark a money tower under 2b's threshold.
**Pre-registered**: (1) H2H vs alice_iter1 > 50% AND >= 16/24 to clear the noise
band; (2) mechanism — towers built in a DefaultLarge trace materially above 3;
(3) the big-map recoveries from 2b (Huge/Money/Oasis) are retained.
Run: 20260906-185051.

### Standing bytecode check (2b build, DefaultLarge full 2000-round game)
Rounds 1000-1999: **0 overruns, 0 near-misses** (indicator counters OVR=/near=
never appear). Peak observed: soldiers 1638 / 17500 (9%), towers 534 / 20000
(3%). **Implication**: bytecode is nowhere near binding — expensive logic
(BFS/bug-nav, symmetry inference, per-tile pattern computation, wider sensing
loops) is affordable and should not be avoided on cost grounds.

### Engine trap found (RULES.md updated)
`transferPaint(loc, -N)` credits the withdrawer through `addPaint`, which clamps
at capacity, while the tower is debited the FULL N. Over-asking silently burns
tower paint. Any refill code must request `min(myCapacity - myPaint, towerPaint)`.
