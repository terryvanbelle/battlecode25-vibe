# Bob — TRAINING_LOG.md (append-only)

Conventions (**superseded 2026-09-06, see below**): dev map set `DEV12` =
DefaultSmall DefaultMedium DefaultLarge DefaultHuge Circuit FourCorners Gears maze
Money Oasis Thirds gridworld (12 maps, x2 sides).
Full evaluation = gauntlet over current peer pool + head-to-head vs last
accepted snapshot.

**METHODOLOGY CHANGE 2026-09-06 (coordinator, effective from run 20260906-202139+1).**
`tools/gauntlet.sh` with `MAPS` unset now draws a FRESH RANDOM sample of 25 maps
from the 75 in `tools/bc25-maps.txt` (50 games/opponent). DEV12 is retired as a
standing list: a fixed hand-picked map set is an overfitting surface, and my
accepted iterations would drift toward those 12 maps. Consequences for reading
this log:

- **Win rates recorded BEFORE this line (iterations 0-3) are on DEV12, 24 games.
  Win rates AFTER it are on a resampled 25-map draw, 50 games. They are not the
  same instrument — never compare the raw percentages across that boundary.**
- Within a run the sample is shared by all opponents, so the head-to-head accept
  gate (a within-run comparison) is unaffected and stays valid.
- When run-to-run comparability is actually needed — regression vs an old
  snapshot, an ablation arm, or re-running a map to trace it — pin the sample
  with `MAPS="$(cat gauntlet/<run-id>/maps.txt)"`.
- Upside for my specific problem: my recurring finding is that near-mirror
  matchups split by side on most maps and that swept-map counts are the sturdier
  signal. 25 maps per run gives roughly double the swept-map evidence per run,
  and the binomial noise floor on 50 games is ~3.5 games (~7pts), so a
  swept-map/win-rate move now has to clear a computable bar. Fixed old-bot roster (per updated algorithm 2026-09-06): every 5th
accepted snapshot (iter1, iter5, iter10, ...), run every ~5 accepted iterations.

## Phase 0 (2026-09-06)

**Spec + engine ground truth** → `RULES.md`. Sources: official specs.pdf V3.1.0 +
reflection dump of battlecode25-java-3.1.0.jar + engine source (GitHub). Key facts:

- Win = paint >70% of paintable tiles (or annihilation). Tiebreak: painted area,
  towers, money, paint sum, robots. 2000 rounds.
- Units cannot damage units — only towers take attack damage. Unit-v-unit combat is
  paint attrition (moppers) + tower fire. Soldier/splasher/mopper: 250/150/50 HP.
- Only splashers (r²≤2 of target) and moppers remove enemy paint. Soldiers cannot.
- Paint = per-robot ammo + timer: territory penalties/turn (neutral −1, enemy −2,
  +1/adjacent ally, doubled in enemy territory; moppers pay 2× territory part),
  <50% stash → up to +100% cooldowns, 0 paint → frozen, −20 HP/turn.
- Towers: start 2 (paint L2 + money L2, both 500 paint). Money L2 = 30 chips/turn.
  Max 25. Tower AoE = attack(null), hits ALL enemies in r²9 (defense 16) for 10-30 +
  single-block 20-60. Defense tower r²16 outranges soldier r²9.
- SRP: 200 chips, +3 resources/turn per mining tower per active SRP after 50
  undisturbed rounds — scales multiplicatively with tower count.
- Comms: robot↔tower only, needs ally-paint connectivity, r²20; tower↔tower
  broadcast r²80. 1 msg/turn robots, 20 towers. Markers = shared map blackboard.
- Bytecode: 17500 robots / 20000 towers. Exceptions cost 500. Team wall-clock cap
  20 min/match (auto-resign!).
- Patterns decoded in RULES.md (resource/paint/money/defense 5x5 bitmasks).

**Determinism**: VERIFIED. Same match run 4x: identical outcome (win r187), and
replay files are BYTE-IDENTICAL for identical games → arm-to-arm identity checks can
`cmp` replays directly. Caveat discovered: the FIRST run after a source change once
produced a result consistent with a stale build (example-copy behavior). Rule: never
trust a single first-run result right after syncing new source; gauntlet.sh builds
before running and is safe.

**Bytecode monitoring**: wired into v0 (RobotPlayer): confirmed-overrun counter
(round changed across own turn body) + Clock.getBytecodeNum() vs limit + max,
surfaced in every indicator string. Checked on every evaluation.

**Symmetry audit stance**: v0 tie-breaks use per-robot rng (seeded by id) for
direction iteration starts and wander; tower-type choice keyed on (ruin.x+ruin.y)
parity (map-symmetric). Mirror-match check scheduled once lineage has 2+ iterations.

**Infrastructure**: vm-match.sh + gauntlet.sh (shared tools) work; replays byte-
comparable; match logs pulled to logs/. Replay-to-text parser deferred until traces
need it (match stdout + indicators may suffice; revisit).

---

## Iteration 0 (2026-09-06) — baseline v0 — ACCEPTED (baseline)

Bot: package `bob` v0. Towers: AoE+focused attack, soldier-heavy spawn (S,S,SPL@r>60,
S,M cycle), 1200-chip reserve after r30. Soldiers: nearest-free-ruin capture
(money/paint tower by ruin parity), refill <50 paint, shoot adjacent enemy towers,
paint-under-self, persistent wander. Moppers: adjacent-robot mop, swing if ≥2 in
zone, mop enemy tiles, seek enemy paint. Splashers: cluster-scored splash ≥5 value.
Nav: greedy + slide, avoids enemy paint, stuck-kick.

Snapshot: src/bob_iter0. Evaluation: gauntlet vs examplefuncsplayer on DEV12 (24
games) — results below when complete.

Result: 24/24 (100%) vs examplefuncsplayer on DEV12, all 12 maps swept. 0 exceptions.
Bytecode (mirror DefaultMedium trace): towers ~550, soldiers ~1k, moppers ~1.9k,
splashers ~8.3k max of 17500; ov=0 everywhere. examplefuncsplayer classified
BENCHMARK-beaten (100% x2 would retire it; keep as occasional sanity check only).
Baseline accepted; bob_iter0 is the first h2h gate.

---

## Iteration 1 (2026-09-06) — soldier idle-action painting — ACCEPTED

Target (structural/degeneracy): mirror needed 1757 rounds to reach 70% paint on
DefaultMedium — soldiers idle their action on most turns (only painted own tile when
non-ally, or pattern tiles). Absolute stall signal, no opponent needed.

Hypothesis: using idle actions to paint the nearest EMPTY tile within action r²9
(own tile first; skip marked tiles to not fight patterns) raises team paint rate →
faster 70% and h2h win. Pre-registered: (1) h2h vs bob_iter0 DEV12 >50% (accept
gate), (2) median win-round vs examplefuncsplayer drops vs iteration-0 run.

Change: Soldier.paintSomething() — own tile if non-ally else nearest empty passable
unmarked tile in r²9. PAINT_FLOOR=15 unchanged.

Evaluation (gauntlet 20260906-183531): **16/24 (66.7%) vs bob_iter0**, swept-win
4/12, swept-loss 0, split 8. Losses scattered both sides (5 of 8 at r2000
tiebreak) — no one-directional regression. ACCEPT. Snapshot src/bob_iter1.
Secondary metric (round-speed vs examplefuncsplayer) run follows.

Learning: splits-by-side on 8/12 maps in near-mirror matchups — side asymmetry is
large relative to this feature's edge; swept-map counts are the sturdier signal.

Iter1 secondary metric (gauntlet 20260906-184306 vs examplefuncsplayer, 24/24):
win rounds dropped on most maps (Money 464→209, FourCorners 427→304, DefaultLarge
469→319) — consistent with higher paint rate. WATCH: DefaultHuge/Gears/maze slid
from decisive (r991–1654) to r2000-tiebreak wins — on big/corridor maps idle
painting may thin soldiers' stashes (more refills, slower deep push). CAVEAT: this
run overlapped the iter2 candidate rebuild on the VM (shared build/classes) — late
games may have run iter2 code. RULE (infrastructure): never run two gauntlets from
the same workspace concurrently; results.csv rows after a rebuild are poisoned.

---

## Iteration 2 (2026-09-06) — paint-starved mopper fallback at non-regen towers — REJECTED

Target: traced loss iter1-vs-iter0 Thirds botA (replays/iter01_bobiter0_Thirds_A_LOSS):
A built 1 tower vs B's 15; A coverage DECLINED 195→137 per-mil; 14k chips unspent.
Root mechanism: money towers never regen paint → after 2 soldier spawns their stash
is dead; chips gate nothing, PAINT gates everything.

Attempt 1 (rejected at mechanism stage): any tower spawns mopper when stash <
soldier cost & chips ≥ reserve+800. Backfired: paint towers' 10/turn regen hits 100
→ mopper spawns preempt soldiers 2:1 → paint output collapsed, Thirds-A loss got
WORSE (r755 vs r1199), money pinned at 1850. Learning: trigger-frequency pre-check
failure — "stash < 200" is the steady state at paint towers.

Attempt 2 (current): fallback only at towers with paintPerTurn==0 (their stash IS
dead weight) and chips ≥ 1500. Mechanism check Thirds-A vs iter0: engaged, A ahead
at r300 (214 vs 193 cov), still lost r1715 — B's Thirds-side economy (76k money,
15 towers) dwarfs the fix; class-2 proceed (side asymmetry documented in iter1).

ALSO OBSERVED (both lineages): 26k–76k chips unspent by late game; nobody upgrades
towers or builds SRPs. Spending idle chips (upgrades/SRPs/defense) is likely the
next structural win. → backlog.

Pre-registered: h2h vs bob_iter1 DEV12 >50% gate; no swept-loss regression.

**RESULT (gauntlet 20260906-184918): 12/24 = exactly 50.0% — REJECTED.**
Swept-win 1/12, swept-loss 1, split-by-side 10. The gate was a strict majority
(>50%) and 12/24 is not one; per measurement doctrine #5 a ~50% h2h is a near
miss, not an accept, absent a separate mechanistic argument, and there is none
here — the mechanism engaged (verified) and bought nothing. Compare iter1's
accept: 16/24 with swept-win 4 / swept-loss 0. This is a coin flip by contrast,
and the split-by-side count rose 8 → 10, i.e. the run got *more* side-dominated,
not less. Reverted `src/bob/Tower.java` fully; `bob_iter1` remains the h2h gate.

Functional-area status: **tower spawn composition / paint-starvation — CLOSED
(2 consecutive rejects).** Both attempts assumed converting a dead paint stash
into a unit was the win. Attempt 1 died on trigger frequency, attempt 2 on a
null effect. The next attempt must leave this area (algorithm §1,
MaxConsecutiveRejects). Ledger entry below.

---

## Closed-directions ledger

| direction | killed by |
|---|---|
| Tower spawns a mopper when its paint stash is below soldier cost (any tower) | iter2 attempt 1: "stash < 200" is the *steady state* at paint towers, so the fallback preempted soldiers 2:1; Thirds-A loss got worse (r755 vs r1199) |
| Same, restricted to towers with `paintPerTurn == 0` and chips ≥ 1500 | iter2 attempt 2: h2h vs iter1 exactly 12/24 (50.0%), swept 1–1. Mechanism engaged, effect nil |

---

## Structural trace (2026-09-06) — the real degeneracy

Ran `bob-tools/dump-replay.sh` over the iter2 losses. `gridworld` botA, per 50
rounds (`round, covA, covB, moneyA, moneyB, srpA, srpB, died, turns`):

```
 50, 226,205,    440,  1410, 0,0,0, 24
150, 488,433,   2040,  6100, 0,0,0, 54      <-- coverage PEAK
200, 498,445,  11040, 11890, 0,0,0, 56      <-- robot-count peak
500, 463,486,  63690, 64540, 0,0,0, 48
1000,469,493, 151440,160590, 0,0,0, 48
2000,424,542, 326940,357090, 0,0,0, 48
```

Three absolute degeneracy signals, no opponent needed:

1. **327,000 chips unspent at r2000** (both teams). Chips pass 8k by ~r180 and
   then grow ~175/turn forever. Chips are a dead resource for this bot.
2. **Coverage peaks at round 150 (48.8%) and then DECLINES** to ~42–45%. The
   win condition is 70%. Everything after r150 is a stall; the last tower is
   built at r167 and nothing changes again for 1800 rounds.
3. **0 SRPs, ever**, on either side.

**Engine probe (authoritative, `javap -c` on battlecode25-java-3.1.0.jar) —
three facts that explain the stall:**

- `InternalRobot.<init>` sets `paintAmount = 0`. A newly completed tower spawns
  with **zero paint**. Only the two starting towers get INITIAL_TOWER_PAINT_AMOUNT.
- `MONEY` towers have `paintPerTurn == 0`. Combined with the above: **every money
  tower we build is a permanently sterile spawn point** — it can never accumulate
  the 200 paint a soldier costs, and it produces the one resource we already have
  327k of. `Soldier.towerTypeFor` splits ruins 50/50 by parity, so roughly half
  our captured ruins are dead weight.
- `InternalRobot.processBeginningOfRound`:
  `if (paintPerTurn != 0) addPaint(paintPerTurn + gameWorld.extraResourcesFromPatterns(team))`
  and `extraResourcesFromPatterns = numResourcePatterns * 3`. So **an SRP gives
  +3 PAINT/turn to every paint tower**, not just +3 chips to money towers. With
  P paint towers and N SRPs that is +3·N·P paint/turn for 200 chips each.
- `assertCanUpgradeTower` requires only: target within r²≤2, ally tower,
  `canUpgradeType()`, chips ≥ `getNextLevel().moneyCost`. **No action check, no
  cooldown added** — so a tower can upgrade *itself* (distance 0) on any turn,
  for free, alongside attacking and spawning. `InternalRobot.upgradeTower` keeps
  the paint stash and carries missing-HP across (+500 max HP).

Conclusion: paint income is the single binding constraint on this bot, chips are
free, and the engine offers three untouched paint-income multipliers (upgrade
paint towers, build paint towers instead of money towers, SRPs). That is the
iteration queue for 3/4/5, one at a time.

---

## Iteration 3 (2026-09-06) — idle-chip tower self-upgrade — ACCEPTED

Target: structural track / absolute degeneracy #1 above (327k unspent chips,
coverage plateau from r150). New area — leaves the closed spawn-composition
thread as required.

Hypothesis: converting surplus chips into tower levels raises paint income
(paint tower 5→10→15/turn) and so raises unit production past the r150 plateau,
which raises coverage. Chips are non-binding, so the spend is ~free.

Change (isolated, `src/bob/Tower.java`): a tower self-upgrades when
`chips >= getNextLevel().moneyCost + UPGRADE_RESERVE` (UPGRADE_RESERVE = 4000,
i.e. four tower-builds still in hand). Timeline marker "upgrade" on each.

Pre-checks: **Reachability** — chips exceed 5000+4000 by ~r180 in every traced
game, and 100k+ by r1000. Passes emphatically. **Trigger frequency** — fires
once per tower per level, ~20 times/game, saturating by ~r400; it cannot fire
often enough to crowd anything out. **History** — no prior iteration
established the un-upgraded behavior; it was simply never coded.

Mechanism verification (single match, gridworld, bob vs bob_iter1, side A —
the same map/side that lost in run 184918): **WON r2000 on painted-area
tiebreak, 534 vs 407 per-mil** (baseline: LOSS, 424 vs 542). 20 upgrade markers
for our team. Chips dip early as designed (r400: 8,070 vs baseline 46,140).
Class 1 (won) — proceed.

Pre-registered accept criteria:
1. **h2h vs bob_iter1 on DEV12 > 50%** (i.e. ≥13/24) — accept gate.
2. swept-win > swept-loss (no one-directional regression).
3. Secondary/mechanistic: r2000 coverage in the traced win exceeds baseline.

Note for interpretation: chips still reach 551k by r2000 in the traced game
(money towers at L3 mine 40/turn), so this iteration *does not* fix the dead-chip
problem — it only takes the one cheap sink the engine offers. Degeneracy #1
stays open for iterations 4–5 (paint-tower bias, SRPs).

**RESULT (gauntlet 20260906-202139, DEV12): 21/24 = 87.5% vs bob_iter1 — ACCEPTED.**

| | iter1 accept (vs iter0) | iter2 reject (vs iter1) | **iter3 (vs iter1)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| h2h | 16/24 (66.7%) | 12/24 (50.0%) | **21/24 (87.5%)** |
| swept-win | 4/12 | 1/12 | **9/12** |
| swept-loss | 0 | 1 | **0** |
| split-by-side | 8 | 10 | **3** |

All three pre-registered criteria met. The diff shape is the strongest evidence
here and it is one-directional: Circuit, FourCorners, DefaultHuge, Gears and
DefaultSmall all went from split-by-side to swept wins. **The split-by-side count
collapsed 10 → 3** — games stopped being decided by which spawn we got, which is
exactly what a real capability gain (rather than churn) looks like against the
side-asymmetry finding logged in iteration 1. Win rounds also fell sharply
(DefaultMedium A 1592→510, DefaultLarge A 1854→716, Money 2000→897).

Remaining losses: DefaultLarge B r1879, maze B r2000, Thirds B r2000 — all side B,
all late/tiebreak, none a sweep against us.

Snapshot: `src/bob_iter3` (there is no `bob_iter2`; iteration 2 was rejected).
`bob_iter3` is now the h2h gate. Representative replay archived:
`replays/iter03_bobiter1_gridworld_A_WIN.bc25` (the mechanism-verification game —
the exact map/side that lost in run 184918, won here 534 vs 407 per-mil).

Accepted-iteration count: 3 (iter0, iter1, iter3). Fixed old-bot roster run
(iter1 + iter5 …) is due at the next accept-count multiple of 5 — flagged so it
is not treated as "later".

**Learning (durable).** The winner's-profile line in TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md —
*capability preserved at zero marginal cost: standing defenses, spending idle
resources, removing pure waste* — paid out on the first try here, and it beat two
consecutive clever-mechanism attempts (iteration 2) by 37 points. The generalisable
move was not the idea but the instrument: dumping raw per-round replay counters
(`bob-tools/dump-replay.sh`) and reading them for **absolute degeneracy** rather
than for an opponent-relative deficit. "327k chips unspent" and "coverage peaks at
r150 and then declines" need no opponent to be obviously wrong, and both had been
sitting in every replay since iteration 0. Do the counter dump before theorising.

---

## Iteration 4 (2026-09-06) — paint-tower bias in ruin capture — REJECTED

Target: structural degeneracy #1 again (chips still dead: 551k at r2000 *after*
iteration 3 upgrades), attacked from the other side — stop manufacturing the dead
resource. New sub-target, not a refinement of iteration 3.

Evidence: `Soldier.towerTypeFor` picks money vs paint tower by `(ruin.x+ruin.y)&1`,
so ~half of every ruin we capture becomes a money tower. Engine-verified, a money
tower has `paintPerTurn == 0` and a newly completed tower starts at
`paintAmount == 0`, so **a money tower we build is a permanently sterile spawn
point** — it can never accumulate the 200 paint a soldier costs — and it mines the
resource we already pile 551k of. Meanwhile paint income is the binding constraint
on unit production and therefore on coverage.

Hypothesis: building paint towers instead of money towers after the early
expansion phase raises paint income roughly in proportion to the paint-tower
count, and so raises coverage and the h2h.

Change (isolated, one expression in `Soldier.towerTypeFor`): money tower only
while `roundNum <= MONEY_TOWER_UNTIL` (dose parameter, 100), paint tower after.
Round number is a shared, exactly team-symmetric signal — strictly better on the
symmetry audit than the current absolute-coordinate parity, which is not
preserved under the map's rotation/reflection.

Pre-checks: **Reachability** — towers are built at r18/39/58/85/100/105/129/139/167
in the traced game, so a r100 cut-off splits them ~4 money / ~5 paint; the branch
is taken every game. **Trigger frequency** — fires once per ruin captured, ~9
times/game. **History** — the parity rule was never justified by measurement; it
was an arbitrary iteration-0 default ("mix money and paint towers"), so this
supersedes nothing that evidence established. **Risk to check in the trace** —
with fewer money towers, chips may stop being free (iteration 3's upgrades want
7,500/tower); if chips go to zero the dose is too aggressive and MONEY_TOWER_UNTIL
should rise. That is the dose sweep if this comes back a near miss.

Pre-registered accept criteria (first run under the NEW resampled 25-map default):
1. **h2h vs bob_iter3 > 50%** (≥26/50) — accept gate.
2. swept-win > swept-loss.
3. Mechanistic: team chips at r2000 in a traced game are materially below the
   551k baseline (i.e. the change actually removed money income), AND r2000
   coverage is not lower. If chips collapse toward 0 *and* coverage drops, the
   dose is too aggressive — refine rather than reject.

**Implementation correction made before running** (worth recording, it was nearly
a self-inflicted bug). The first draft keyed the choice on `roundNum <= 100`.
That is unsafe: `workOnRuin` marks the ruin's 5x5 with one type's pattern and then
refuses to re-mark (its probe is "is any tile marked?"), so a ruin whose type
changed between marking and completion can never be completed — a soldier would
sit on it forever. **The tower type must be a pure function of the ruin, never of
time.** Shipped instead as a stable mask on the ruin coordinates,
`((ruin.x + ruin.y) & MONEY_SHARE) == 0`, with MONEY_SHARE as the dose parameter:
1 = one ruin in two is money (iterations 0-3, the zero arm), 3 = one in four
(this arm), larger = fewer still.

Mechanism verification (single match, gridworld, bob vs bob_iter3, side A):
**WON AT ROUND 804 BY MAJORITY_PAINTED — 70.2% coverage.** This is the lineage's
first ever win by the actual win condition; every prior game in every prior run
ended at the r2000 area tiebreak around 45-55%. Per-round trace:

```
round  covA  covB   moneyA   moneyB   turns
  250   532   432     5760     5950      64
  500   564   394     6010    24770      74
  750   698   268     6220   100290      83
  804   702   264     7620   114210      85
```

All three pre-registered mechanistic predictions hit at once: our chips stop
piling up (7.6k vs the baseline's 114k on the same round, i.e. income is now
fully consumed by iteration 3's upgrades instead of dying in the treasury),
coverage rises monotonically with no r150 plateau, and the robot count reaches 85
against the ~48 that every earlier trace showed. Class 1 (won) — proceed to the
full run.

---

## Standing audit items (not yet measured)

- **`Nav.navTo` has a fixed handedness.** Its candidate list is
  `{d, d.rotateLeft(), d.rotateRight(), d.rotateLeft().rotateLeft(), …}` — left is
  always tried before right. This is exactly the fixed absolute-order tie-break
  TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md §7 names as the largest bug class in both prior projects:
  it interacts with map geometry to favour one side. It is a plausible contributor
  to the persistent split-by-side result, and it is untested. Mirror-match (bot vs
  byte-identical copy, both sides, all maps) is the instrument. Note the caution
  recorded there: a consistent arbitrary preference can be supplying real formation
  cohesion, so randomising it can be a net regression — measure, don't assume.
- **Comms are entirely unused.** An API sweep against `src/bob/` (algorithm phase
  0.2) shows `sendMessage`, `broadcastMessage`, `readMessages`, `canSendMessage`
  and `canBroadcastMessage` are never called, along with the whole marker API and,
  until iteration 5, the whole SRP API. Symmetry inference and target
  deconfliction both live here.
- **Our own splashers can break our own SRPs.** `Splasher.run` scores EMPTY tiles
  and splashes an r²≤4 AoE that repaints in primary; a finished SRP's 25 tiles must
  keep their exact primary/secondary colours or the engine resets the pattern to
  neutral and restarts its 50-round activation clock. Watch `srpA` in the replay
  dump: if SRPs are built but the count keeps falling back, this is the cause.



### Iteration 4 trace — THE RESERVE DEAD BAND (the real find of this run)

Run 20260906-203014 (first under the resampled 25-map default) went badly on maps
this lineage had never seen: hovering around 47-50% against bob_iter3, with swept
losses on starburst, Racetrack and Snowglobe. Dumped both swept losses.

`starburst` bot=A (us), per 100 rounds:
```
round covA covB moneyA moneyB
  100  321  414   1250    500
  300  382  602   1350   2350
  500  320  646   1300   1900
  526  280  700    780   2800   <- B wins by MAJORITY_PAINTED
```
`Snowglobe` bot=A (us), per 75 rounds:
```
   75  191  240    750   1360
  225  273  489   1200   1760
  375  302  667   1350   6450
  453  267  700   1290   5040   <- B wins by MAJORITY_PAINTED
```

**Our chips sat pinned between 1200 and 1350 for the entire game, on both maps.**
That number is `Tower.reserve` itself (1200). A soldier costs 250, so spawning
required 1450 chips and simply never happened — for hundreds of consecutive
rounds, on every tower we owned. Coverage decayed (428 → 280, 302 → 267) because
nothing replaced the units that died, while the opponent walked to 70%.

This is the "resource pinned in a dead band" signal TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md §1 names
as preferable to any opponent-relative comparison, and it needed no opponent to be
obviously wrong. Two things about it are worth recording:

1. **The reserve was protecting an expansion that had already finished.** Its
   purpose is to keep 1,000 chips free so a soldier can complete a tower pattern
   the instant it is ready. On a ruin-poor map the last ruin is captured early;
   after that the 1,200 chips protect nothing whatsoever while blocking all unit
   production. A fixed constant converted a modest income shortfall into
   *permanently zero* output.
2. **This bug is in bob_iter3 as well** — it is not something iteration 4
   introduced. Iteration 4's paint-tower bias lowered chip income enough to push
   many more maps into the band, which is how it became visible. It had been
   invisible for four iterations because every map tested until today was
   ruin-rich enough that chips ran away to six figures.

Refinement (iteration 4b), self-calibrating per the algorithm's stated preference
over fixed constants: hold the expansion reserve only while the team's tower count
is still growing. `rc.getNumberTowers()` is team-global and engine-verified to
return our own team's count, so every tower agrees without needing comms; if the
count has not moved for `EXPANSION_IDLE` = 200 rounds, there is nothing to reserve
for and the reserve drops to 0. A tower being destroyed also re-arms it, which is
right — a destroyed tower frees its ruin for rebuilding.

Next run is designed to separate the two effects on ONE shared map sample:
`bob` (paint bias 1-in-4 + reserve fix) against `bob_i4a` (the paint bias alone,
frozen byte-identical to what ran here — so this is an exact isolation of the
reserve fix in the regime where it is actually reachable), `bob_iter3` (the accept
gate, neither change), and the frozen roster `bob_iter0` + `bob_iter1` for the
absolute-strength chart. Reachability note for honesty: the reserve fix is nearly
dead code under iter3's own economy, where chips run to 551k and the band is never
occupied — it is reachable *because of* the paint bias, so the two are a genuine
interaction and any accept here is for the pair, not for either alone.


### Iteration 4 RESULT — REJECTED

**Run 20260906-203014: 22/50 = 44.0% vs bob_iter3. swept-win 6/25, swept-loss 9,
split-by-side 10.** Both pre-registered criteria failed: the h2h is below 50%, and
swept-loss exceeds swept-win. The deficit is 6 points below the gate against a
~7pt binomial noise floor on 50 games, but the swept-map asymmetry (9 maps lost
from BOTH sides against 6 won from both) is the sturdier signal and it is
one-directional. REJECT. Paint bias reverted; `src/bob_i4a` deleted.

**What the rejection bought** (a rejection that converts a weakly-founded belief
into a firmly-founded one has paid for its run):

The premise was verified and the conclusion was still wrong, which is worth
stating precisely. Money towers really are permanently sterile spawn points — that
is engine fact, not inference. What the hypothesis missed is that **iteration 3
turned chips INTO paint income**: an upgrade buys +5 paint/turn for 2,500 chips.
Once that conversion exists, money towers are no longer producing a dead resource,
they are producing the feedstock for paint income, and starving the treasury
starves the upgrades. Rough arithmetic on the traced games: iter3 runs ~5 paint
towers upgraded to L3 for 5 x 15 = 75 paint/turn; the 1-in-4 arm runs ~8 paint
towers that it can never afford to upgrade, for 8 x 5 = 40 paint/turn. **More paint
towers, less paint.**

This is the algorithm's own warning about supersession, inverted: I did not
contradict a previous iteration's evidence, I failed to notice that a previous
iteration had *changed the economics the new hypothesis depended on*. Iteration 3
was two hours old. Ledger entry added.

Note the gridworld result stands and is not contradicted: the 1-in-4 arm won there
at r804 by MAJORITY_PAINTED. gridworld is ruin-rich, so it could afford both more
paint towers and their upgrades. The arm is bad on ruin-poor maps, which the
resampled 25-map draw contains far more of than DEV12 did — an early vindication
of the coordinator's map-resampling change, since DEV12 would have hidden this.

Closed-directions ledger, new entry:

| direction | killed by |
|---|---|
| Bias ruin capture toward paint towers (1 in 4 money instead of 1 in 2) | iter4: 22/50 (44%) vs bob_iter3, swept-loss 9 > swept-win 6. Chips buy paint income back through iteration 3's upgrades, so starving money starves upgrades and nets less paint. Re-open only with evidence that changes that arithmetic — e.g. if a cheaper paint-income source (SRPs) makes upgrades non-critical |

## Iteration 5 (2026-09-06) — self-calibrating expansion reserve — running

Target: the reserve dead band traced above. Carried forward from iteration 4 as an
independent change, with the rejected paint bias stripped out, so the accept test
is a single isolated change against bob_iter3.

Hypothesis: `Tower.reserve` is a fixed 1,200 chips held back for tower completion.
When income is modest the treasury pins at that value and unit production stops
entirely and permanently — traced on two maps for hundreds of consecutive rounds.
Holding the reserve only while the team is actually still expanding removes a pure
waste with no capability cost.

Change (isolated, `src/bob/Tower.java`): track `rc.getNumberTowers()` (team-scoped,
engine-verified); if it has not changed for `EXPANSION_IDLE` = 200 rounds, set the
reserve to 0. A destroyed tower re-arms it, which is correct — it frees a ruin.

Reachability caveat, stated up front for honesty: under bob_iter3's own economy
chips run to 551k and the band is rarely occupied, so this change may be close to
a no-op on ruin-rich maps. It was clearly reachable under iteration 4's economy.
The resampled map draw contains many ruin-poor maps, which is where it should
bite. If it comes back a clean no-op rather than a regression, that is a
"mechanistically correct but upstream state never produces the situation" result
and it should be kept in mind for when a later iteration changes the economy again
— not discarded.

Evaluation run 20260906-2136ish, 15 maps x 2 sides, four opponents on one shared
sample: `bob_iter3` (accept gate), plus the frozen roster `bob_iter0`, `bob_iter1`
and `examplefuncsplayer` for the absolute-strength chart.

Pre-registered accept criteria:
1. **h2h vs bob_iter3 > 50%** (≥16/30) — accept gate.
2. swept-win ≥ swept-loss.
3. Mechanistic: on a ruin-poor map from the sample, team chips no longer sit
   pinned at 1200-1350 for the whole game.

## Iteration 6 (2026-09-06) — Special Resource Patterns — prepared, gated on iteration 5

Target: the third and largest untouched paint-income multiplier found in the
iteration-3 engine probe. Whole game mechanic, never used by this bot (confirmed
by the API sweep: `getResourcePattern`, `canMarkResourcePattern`,
`markResourcePattern`, `canCompleteResourcePattern`, `completeResourcePattern`
are all uncalled), and `srpA`/`srpB` are 0 in every replay ever dumped, on both
sides.

Engine ground truth (`InternalRobot.processBeginningOfRound`):
```
if (type.paintPerTurn != 0) addPaint(type.paintPerTurn + gameWorld.extraResourcesFromPatterns(team));
if (type.moneyPerTurn != 0) teamInfo.addMoney(team, type.moneyPerTurn + gameWorld.extraResourcesFromPatterns(team));
```
with `extraResourcesFromPatterns(team) = 3 * numResourcePatterns(team)`. So an SRP
is **+3 paint/turn on every allied PAINT tower**, not merely +3 chips on money
towers — the spec's phrase "mining towers" hides that. With P paint towers and N
SRPs the paint income is P·(base + 3N).

Chip efficiency vs the accepted iteration 3 mechanism: an SRP costs 200 chips for
+3 paint/turn × P towers; a tower upgrade costs 2500 chips for +5 paint/turn × 1
tower. At P ≈ 8 the SRP is ~30× better per chip, which is why `SRP_MIN_CHIPS` is
set at 500 — below iteration 3's upgrade threshold, so SRPs win the race for chips.
This matters now in a way it would not have before iteration 4: chips stopped being
free (7.6k at r804 vs 114k for iter3), so the two mechanisms genuinely compete.

Implementation (in `Soldier`, isolated; already written and compile-verified on
the VM in an isolated directory that does not touch the workspace build):
an idle soldier — one with no ruin to capture — marks a resource pattern on its
own square, paints the 25 tiles to match the marks it just wrote, and completes it.
Standing on the centre puts all 25 tiles inside the soldier's own r²≤9 action
radius, so it never has to move while building.
`canMarkResourcePattern` is left to enforce the geometry (centre ≥2 from every
edge, all 25 tiles paintable) rather than re-deriving it. `srpSiteSafe` adds the
three checks the engine does not: no enemy paint (a soldier cannot overwrite it,
so the site could never be completed), no overlap with a finished SRP, and no tile
already marked (which is what prevents two adjacent soldiers from marking
contradictory overlapping patterns and deadlocking each other).

Pre-checks: **Reachability** — soldiers go idle as soon as the nearby ruins are
all captured, which the traces show happens by ~r170; chips exceed 500 from ~r150.
**Trigger frequency** — bounded by idle soldiers and by the no-marked-tile rule.
**Generality** — this is a whole-mechanic gap, not a fix aimed at one game.
**Known interaction to watch** — our own splashers repaint in primary over an r²≤4
AoE and would reset any SRP they clip (the engine re-checks pattern integrity every
round and restarts the 50-round activation clock on any mismatch). Instrument: the
`srpA` column of the replay dump. SRPs built but repeatedly falling back to 0
active means the splasher is eating them, and the fix is a splasher exclusion, not
abandoning the mechanic.

Pre-registered accept criteria:
1. **h2h vs the newest accepted snapshot > 50%** — accept gate.
2. swept-win > swept-loss.
3. Mechanistic (checked first, on one match): `srpA` reaches ≥3 and stays there,
   and the win round drops versus the same map/side baseline.


---

## Backlog / next structural targets (evidence, not speculation)

**The endgame is zero-sum and only two unit types can move the line.** In every
long game the whole map ends up painted by somebody: gridworld iter3-vs-iter1
finished 424 + 542 = 966 per-mil, and the iteration-4 gridworld win finished
702 + 264 = 966. There is no neutral ground left to claim after roughly round 200.
Engine fact: **soldiers cannot overwrite enemy paint at all.** Only splashers (and
only within r²≤2 of the splash centre) and moppers can. So once the map is
saturated, three fifths of our production — the soldiers — can no longer affect
the score at all, and the entire remaining contest runs through the 1 splasher +
1 mopper we build per 5 units (`Tower.spawned % 5`).

That ratio has never been measured; it is an iteration-0 default. It is a clean
dose parameter with an obvious zero arm, and the trigger is universal rather than
situational. Candidate for iteration 7, after SRPs — and note it interacts with
SRPs in the right direction, since more paint income makes the more expensive
splashers (300 paint, 400 chips) affordable.

Watch the confound flagged in TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md's deep regularities before
spending a run on it: "metrics that improve without converting to wins" and
"survival bought with inactivity". The metric to pre-register is enemy-paint
per-mil removed per round, normalised per round, NOT raw tiles mopped.

**Second-order, cheap, unmeasured**: `markResourcePattern` has a public overload
taking a rotation (0-3) and a reflect flag, so a resource pattern can be laid in 8
orientations. Verified in the engine but not needed yet — it would matter only if
site rejection due to contradicting neighbours becomes common in iteration 6.

## ROOT CAUSE FOUND (2026-09-06) — the tower mix degenerates to all-one-type per map

Found by extending `bob-tools/BobDump.java` to read the replay's per-turn action
union (the engine declares `Turn.actions` as a union of flatbuffer *structs*, and
the generated accessor only offers the Table form, so `Cursor` exposes the
protected buffer position and the struct is re-assigned onto it). The dumper now
reports, per team: cumulative spawns by unit type, total robot paint, enemy-paint
removals per interval, and peak bytecode. RobotType indices verified by running
the enum, not assumed: NONE=0, PAINT_TOWER=1, MONEY_TOWER=2, DEFENSE_TOWER=3,
SOLDIER=4, SPLASHER=5, MOPPER=6.

Tower types actually built (paint / money), across every replay on disk:

| map | our side | their side |
|---|---|---|
| gridworld | **0 paint / 9 money** | **0 paint / 8 money** |
| starburst | **4 paint / 0 money** | **3 paint / 0 money** |
| Snowglobe | **4 paint / 0 money** | 2 paint / 1 money |
| Thirds | **1 paint / 0 money** | 5 paint / 3 money |

`Soldier.towerTypeFor` has been `((ruin.x + ruin.y) & 1) == 0 ? MONEY : PAINT`
since iteration 0, commented "mix money and paint towers". **It does not mix.**
Ruin centres are constrained to be ≥5 apart and maps lay them out on regular
lattices, so on any given map they overwhelmingly share one parity of `x+y` and
every ruin resolves to the same tower type. The rule is a per-map coin flip that
usually lands on 100% of one type, and it lands on a *different* type on different
maps.

This is precisely the bug class TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md §7 puts first — "any fixed
absolute-order decision ... interacts with map geometry" — and I walked past it
in the iteration 4 comment while congratulating myself on noticing the *time*
dependence hazard in the same function.

**It is the common root cause of both degeneracies this session chased.**

- Iteration 3's story (327k → 551k unspent chips, paint starving unit production)
  is the *all-money* degeneracy. On gridworld our entire paint income for 2000
  rounds was the single starting paint tower. The upgrade mechanism was accepted
  at 87.5% because it was the only way to get paint out of a lineage that was
  building zero paint towers on that map.
- Iteration 4's story (chips pinned at 1200-1350 in the reserve dead band) is the
  *all-paint* degeneracy on starburst and Snowglobe, where we built 4 paint towers
  and zero money towers and had no chip income beyond the one starting tower.

It also explains iteration 4's confusing result honestly. Changing the mask from
`&1` to `&3` did not shift a 50/50 mix to 25/75; it re-rolled *which* maps
degenerate *which way*. That shuffles outcomes rather than fixing anything, which
is exactly the scattered mixed-direction pattern the run produced. **The ledger
entry for iteration 4 is therefore downgraded**: the arithmetic argument I wrote
there (chips buy paint income through upgrades, so starving money starves
upgrades) is plausible but was never actually the condition tested, because no arm
ever ran a mixed economy. Re-opening the paint-bias question is legitimate once
the mix is real — the recorded cause genuinely no longer applies.

### Iteration 7 (next, ahead of SRPs): lattice-independent tower mix

Fix must keep the type a pure function of the ruin (the marking deadlock from
iteration 4 still applies) while breaking the correlation with the ruin lattice.
An integer hash with avalanche does both:

```java
int h = ruin.x * 0x27D4EB2D + ruin.y * 0x165667B1;
h ^= h >>> 15; h *= 0x2545F491; h ^= h >>> 13;
return (h & 1) == 0 ? MONEY : PAINT;
```

Stable per ruin, no time dependence, ~10 bytecodes, and the parity of a
well-avalanched hash is uncorrelated with any lattice. It yields a binomial rather
than a guaranteed mix (on a 4-ruin map a 4-0 split still has probability 1/8,
versus near-certainty today), which is a large improvement and a small residual.

The guaranteed-balance version needs an adaptive rule (pick the type our team has
fewer of), and that needs the deadlock hazard removed first, by deriving a ruin's
type from its existing marks rather than recomputing it: fetch
`rc.getTowerPattern()` for both types at runtime, find the first cell where they
disagree, and read the mark there. Noted as the enabler, not attempted yet.

Pre-registered for iteration 7: h2h vs the then-current snapshot > 50%; and the
mechanistic check that makes this worth doing at all — **paint-tower and
money-tower counts must both be non-zero on the great majority of maps in the
sample**, read straight out of the new dumper columns.

### Instrument note

Peak bytecode measured from the replay is **9148 / 17500 (52%)** for our team,
higher than the ~8.3k the in-bot monitor reported at iteration 0. Still safe, but
half the budget is gone and the SRP work in iteration 6 adds two 25-tile scans.
Worth re-checking on every evaluation, as the algorithm requires.
