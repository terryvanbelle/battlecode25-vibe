# Darla — design thesis and standing registration

Started 2026-09-10 by the coordinator, after the user retired alice and carol.
Darla is written from scratch but not from nothing: the isolation firewall that
kept the three lineages apart does not apply to me, so this is the first design in
the project that uses everything all three established at once.

## The thesis

Both surviving lineages spent weeks optimising **economy and coverage**. Both drove
that framing to a genuinely complete enumeration — twenty-plus mechanism axes each,
every design premise closed, committed closure maps — and both lose three quarters
of their games to the external standard (17.3% and 24.7% against `v3`, ~1% and 0%
against `TSPAARKHS`).

Meanwhile the single strongest empirical result anyone produced was an accident.
carol built a 38-line fork of her own bot that sieges towers with splashers,
intending it purely as a measuring stick, and **it beat her 60/40** — the only
opponent in her pool she loses to. It contains no defensive code at all, so the
advantage is a *capability* gap rather than a defensive one, which means it
transfers to whoever adopts it. Nobody did.

**Darla's thesis: tower removal is the lever, and it is available to splashers by
an engine asymmetry nobody exploited.** Economy is a means of producing splashers,
not the objective.

## The nine findings the code is built on

Each is measured, by the lineage named, and each maps to a specific decision in
`src/darla/RobotPlayer.java`.

| # | finding | source | where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | splasher-primary; soldier-primary rejected at −5.71 sd; production efficiency 0.1291 vs 0.0603 tiles per build-paint, replicated across two independent designs | carol, alice | `chooseSpawn` |
| 2 | moppers are **superseded**, not merely inefficient — 0.0000 production over 105 spawns, and a splasher takes enemy ground in one step across 13 tiles where a mopper takes one tile in two steps | alice | never built |
| 3 | `SPLASHER.actionRadiusSquared = 4` reaches distance 4; a paint or money tower answers only to 3. **The splasher out-ranges what it kills.** 100 AoE against 1000 health is ten hits | carol | `runSplasher`, approach stops at the edge of our reach |
| 4 | tower damage is **permanent** — no restoration path, `upgradeTower` carries the deficit forward, towers sit outside `processEndOfTurn`. ~25 hits per kill observed | alice | towers always fire; splashers keep a target |
| 5 | killing the last money tower freezes the victim's production **permanently** — 1,887 consecutive frozen rounds measured | carol | money towers targeted first |
| 6 | spending **is** the investment: cutting spawns 78% banked nothing (147.0 vs 147.4 per tower), because income is per-tower and spawning builds towers | alice | never withhold production |
| 7 | never gate a paint-costly action on chips: rank correlation −0.496, and above a high chip gate the paint clears on **0.0%** of 244 frames | alice | no chip threshold anywhere |
| 8 | a money tower has `paintPerTurn == 0` — two robots and then a dry build site; `buildRobot` draws from the **building** tower's stash | carol | paint towers 3:1 |
| 9 | winning the tower race is not winning: 12–4 on the race, 75% conversion | alice | siege over expansion |

Two further constraints are honoured without being findings about the game:
a constant must not be set above the level its resource normally holds (alice's
reserve of 200 against towers holding 154.8 disabled her own mechanism on 82.9% of
frames), and a persistent heading beats a nearest-target rule, because units are
blocked by robots rather than walls and a nearest-empty rule points a forward unit
backwards (carol).

## Registration for run `20260910-200447` / the first 90-game gauntlet

Written before any result was read.

**This is a shakedown, not a screen.** A v1 from-scratch bot against three mature
lineages is expected to lose; carol's own from-scratch rewrite was rejected at
−5.71 sd and still paid, because it answered a question no cheaper experiment
could. So the win rate is **not** the quantity of interest here.

What the run must establish, in order:

1. **Does it play?** Games complete, no forfeits, no bytecode overruns. If not,
   nothing else in the run means anything.
2. **Does the siege mechanism fire?** Splashers should spend turns in `SIEGE` and
   `APPROACH`, not only painting. A design whose central mechanism never fires is
   untested, not refuted — the trap that cost alice iteration 15b and carol
   iteration 10.
3. **Do towers actually die?** Finding #4 says damage accumulates, so the question
   is whether hits convert to removals at anything like the ~25:1 observed rate.

**What would refute the thesis**, registered now so it cannot be reinterpreted:

- the siege fires often and enemy tower count is unmoved → the range advantage does
  not survive contact, and finding #3 is a fact about the engine that does not
  reach the game;
- Darla wins the ground race and still loses → tower removal is not the lever and
  the thesis is wrong in the same way the two lineages' economy framing was.

**What would support it:** tower kills accumulating over a game, and Darla's wins
concentrated in games where it removed a money tower.

**What is not evidence either way:** the aggregate win rate of a first version.
