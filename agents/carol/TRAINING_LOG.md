# Carol — Training Log (BC25 Chromatic Conflict)

Append-only chronological record per TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md. Newest at the bottom.

## Functional-area map
- econ: tower builds/upgrades, chip spending, SRPs
- paint: painting policy, splasher targeting, paint logistics (refill/transfer)
- combat: tower attacks, mopper harassment, tower sieges
- nav: movement, exploration, symmetry handling
- comms: messages/marks
- infra: instrumentation, evaluation tooling

## Phase 0 (2026-09-06)

**Spec + engine ground truth** → `RULES.md`. Engine v3.1.0 final. Key facts:
- Win: >70% of non-wall squares painted, or annihilation. 2000-round cap, tiebreak
  paint→towers→money→stored paint→robots→coinflip (the only nondeterminism).
- No unit damages enemy robot HP; attrition = tower fire + paint starvation (0 paint =
  -20HP/turn + frozen). Paint denial (moppers) and tower kills are the combat surface.
- Radius asymmetries: vision r2=20 for all; def-tower attack r2=16 < vision; paint/money
  tower attack r2=9; splashers can hit towers from up to r2~16 (out-ranging paint/money
  towers); soldier tower-attack r2=9 exactly matches paint/money tower reach.
- SRP: each active pattern (+50 round undisturbed delay, 200 chips) = +3/turn PER paint
  tower AND +3/turn per money tower. Scales with tower count — strong late econ.
- Clumping penalty: -1 paint/turn per adjacent ally (x2 on enemy ground) — spread out.
- Messaging needs ally-paint connectivity robot<->tower (r2=20); tower<->tower broadcast
  r2=80 unconditional. Marks are free-form per-tile 2-state annotations (1 paint).
- Cooldown penalty below 50% paint: +(100-2X)% — keep stashes above half.

**Determinism**: VERIFIED. Same match 3x → decompressed .bc25 byte-identical (gzip
wrapper differs only by timestamp). Use `tools/replay-strings.py --hash` for arm-to-arm
identity checks.

**Bytecode monitoring**: wired into iteration 0 (round-boundary overrun counter +
near-miss vs limit + max usage, in every indicator string).

**Infra**: vm-match.sh + gauntlet.sh (parallel, raw java, MAXJOBS=3) provided by project.
Added tools/replay-strings.py (indicator-string extraction + semantic replay hash).
Deferred: full flatbuffer replay parser (revisit when tracing needs per-round metrics).

## Iteration 0 (2026-09-06) — ACCEPTED (baseline)

Minimal instrumented bot, package `carol` (replaces seeded examplefuncsplayer copy):
- Towers: attack lowest-HP enemy in range (single) + AoE when enemies present; spawn
  soldier 75% / mopper 25% in random direction.
- Soldiers: refill at adjacent towers when <50%, work nearest empty ruin (money tower
  pattern), attack enemy towers in reach, paint own tile, explore preferring unpainted.
- Moppers: mop adjacent enemy paint, swing at adjacent enemies, explore.
- Splashers: (not spawned) splash-scoring stub.
- Per-robot RNG seeded from ID (play-symmetry: no team-correlated bias).

vs examplefuncsplayer DefaultSmall side A: WIN round 842 (70% paint). Baseline gauntlet
pending. Snapshot: src/carol_iter0.
